# Jigijumper

Please note to use Unity Version 2019.3.9f1 to build the project, other versions are not guaranteed to work.

This project is using unity ads library, you could head to your own unity dashboard, make a project for yourself, and grab two generated numbers, then paste them into JigiJumper/Assets/Game/SettingData/Settings file, parameters gameId_Android and gameId_IOS must be filled. Note the written values for those two in the project are not currently working and aren't valid anymore.

### Update on 01/Nov/2022
I cleaned some code and run the game in Unity Version 2021.3.8f1, so there shouldn't be a problem to open it in the mentioned version. Also currently the app is using my personal Unity Ads IDs, make sure to replace them with your own, I will change when production is ready, they are in forced test mode so no harm to use those if you want.
