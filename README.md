Please note to use Unity Version 2019.3.9f1 to build the project, other versions are not guaranteed to work.

This project is using unity ads library, you could head to your own unity dashboard, make a project for yourself, and grab two generated numbers, then paste them into JigiJumper/Assets/Game/SettingData/Settings file, parameters gameId_Android and gameId_IOS must be filled. Note the written values for those two in the project are not currently working and aren't valid anymore.
